===============================
This is a simple frogger style arcade game.

# Getting Started
* The game will **not** start until the start button is pressed.  
* Once started you can move the player using the arrow keys.  
* The goal is to get as many points as possible before time expires or you have no more lives.
* If you want to play again press New Game.

# Points/Time
* You get one point for making it to the river
* You get five point for each gem.  A new gem will be randomly generated after the current gem is collected.
* You get two lives and two minutes to play.

# Bugs/Contributing
* improvements could be made if collision funtion was a method of enemy
* should probably put all the global functions in a game utility class
